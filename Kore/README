Set the stack size as high as possible. the default 8K is unworkable and I don't feel like encoding the stack in the heap.
One way to do this is run these commands in adb shell as root:
# setprop dalvik.vm.extra-opts "-Xss256k"
# start
# stop
or permanently, by setting in /system/build.prop:
dalvik.vm.extra-opts=-Xss256k

But that's still not really enough stack. It's better to modify the dalvik vm to get rid of the stack size limit. There's a patch for this:
Kore/crap/dalvik-unlimit-stack-size.patch

I've done most of the development with a 10MB stack, and have not run across any stack related problems so far. Here is the /system/build.prop line for 10MB:
dalvik.vm.extra-opts=-Xss10M
