Set the stack size as high as possible. the default 8K is unworkable and I don't feel like encoding the stack in the heap.
One way to do this is run these commands in adb shell as root:
# setprop dalvik.vm.extra-opts "-Xss256k"
# start
# stop
or permanently, by setting in /system/build.prop:
dalvik.vm.extra-opts=-Xss256k
